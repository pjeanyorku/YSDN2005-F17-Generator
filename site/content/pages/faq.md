## How do I access Digital Locker?

Below are the instructions on how to connect to digital locker and create user specific folders, upload content and access them from anywhere through a web browser.

### MacOS

1. From the Finder menu on a Mac computer choose: **Go > Connect to Server...**
2. For the Server Address enter: **afp://digital-locker.design.yorku.ca**
3. Enter your username and password (the same as login credentials you use to access the computers in the design labs at York)
4. Select **Course_Groups** as the volume to be mounted
5. Select the **1006Mw18** folder
6. Select your lab's folder and create a new folder to be used as your own user space using the following naming convention: **lastnamefirstinitial** (one word all lower case) e.g. buchananp
7. Drop/copy your project files inside your own user space/folder (created in step 6)

### Windows

On a PC with Windows operating system, you can use a FTP client to access and upload files to your account.

1. Download a FTP client such as [FileZilla](http://filezilla-project.org/) (remember to download the client program and not the server)
2. Use the following information to access your account
  - Host: digital-locker.design.yorku.ca
  - Username: The same username you usually use to access the computers in the design labs at York
  - Password: Usually your York student number (unless you've changed it)
  - Port: Leave it blank

For account issues email Loris Dotto at [ldotto@yorku.ca](mailto:ldotto@yorku.ca).
